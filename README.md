This is the ultimate chronometer open-source web-app, made with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Planned Features

### Stopwatches
A page of stopwatches. Users can add more stopwatches, remove them, name them, and colour them as they wish.

### Timers
A page of timers. Each timer can be changed into an inteval timer, which allows for multiple timers to be set up in series, using repetitions and multiple durations.

### Clocks
A page of clocks, able to be added through location, time difference, or just local time. Idealy, they should be highly customizable in appearance.

### Alarms
A page of alarms, with cutomization for multiple snooze functions, alarm sounds, appearance, and repetition.

## Customization
Users will be able to customize the website's features and presentation to their heart's content, whether that be colour, shape, stype, text, and more. The idea is that you can make this site whatever you'd like, with a couple pre-made themes to choose from at the beginning.
